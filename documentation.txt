CS50BOT
CS50 Final Project
by Connor Halleck-Dube
connor.halleck-dube@yale.edu

This project requires:
Starcraft: Broodwar v1.16.1 
BWAPI 
ChaosLauncher 
(optional) Visual Studio C++ 


Setup guide:
1. Download BWAPI_412_Setup.exe from https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi/releases to install BWAPI.

At this point, ensure StarCraft/bwapi-data/AI was created by the BWAPI installation. If not already there, copy CS50BOT.dll into this path.


To run the AI:

1. Run ChaosLauncher as administrator 
(BWAPI/ChaosLauncher/Chaoslauncher.exe)
2. Select the BWAPI v4.1.2 Injector (Release)
3. Select "config" and ensure that [ai = CS50BOT.dll] and 
[auto_menu = SINGLE_PLAYER]
4. "Start" to begin the game (after saving bwapi.ini)

P.S.'s:

The entire project is also packaged with its Visual Studio project and solution, in case you want to open the entire project. The Visual Studio project compiles to BWAPI/Release (NOT BWAPI/CS50BOT/Release).

Side note:
It isn't necessary to compile and run a new version of the bot, but in case you wanted to do so:
1. Compile the project within VS. 
2. Go to BWAPI/Release and copy CS50BOT.dll (not .pdb)
3. Paste the bot into Starcraft/bwapi-data/AI, on top of the version currently in that file.
4. Run ChaosLauncher as admin.
